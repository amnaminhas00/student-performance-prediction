This project predicts students’ final grades (G3) based on various factors such as study time, previous scores, family support, and activities. It demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning using Python.

Dataset
The dataset includes student information like age, gender, study habits, failures, parental background, and grades (G1, G2, G3).

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning (Scikit-learn: Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Steps in the Project

Load and inspect the data.

Clean data and convert categorical columns to numeric.

Explore data with visualizations and correlations.

Select features (X) and target (y).

Split data into training and testing sets.

Train a regression model to predict final grades.

Evaluate and visualize predictions.

Analyze feature importance using Random Forest.
Evaluate and visualize predictions.

Optional: Analyze feature importance using Random Forest.
